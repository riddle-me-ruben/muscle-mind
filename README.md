# Muscle-Mind: Fitness Quiz and Challenge Game

**Muscle-Mind** is an interactive quiz game designed to test players’ knowledge of fitness, health, and nutrition while keeping them physically engaged. Players are challenged with a variety of timed questions, and incorrect answers lead to physical exercise penalties such as push-ups or squats, making it both an educational and physically engaging experience.
